<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>In the fourth part of the fifth lesson, we learn to visualise multivariate, numerical datau sing parallel coordinates plots. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables and seeing relationships between them. It can be used to characterise clusters that are detected during customer segmentation.</p>
