The median value is also observed to occur slightly lower than the mode. This suggests a slight left skew in the data. This can be observed in the histogram where a slightly longer tail is seen on the left side of the distribution, where some observations of extreme lower values are seen. This observation of left skewed distribution is most obvious in the distribution of Reading.\nThis shows that half of the Singapore student sample size received Plausible Value scores for each subject that are on the higher end of the maximum possible Plausible Values."

On the other hand, is is observed that there was a slight decrease in the trend between ESCS and Reading when Plausible Valus is less than 400, indicating that there were students who received higher Plausible Values for Reading compared to peers of a slightly higher ESCS."

    "text": "4.4. Relationship Between Student-Teacher Relationship and Performance\nAs the dataset did not provide more granular details on the type of school, whether public, autonomous, or independent, that the students were enrolled in, we have to find proxies to estimate the learning environment provided to each student. One such proxy we use in this exercise is the quality of student-teacher relationship as perceived by the students1.\n\n\nCodes to generate individual plots\nrelatst_math &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_sg_data, \n       aes(x = MATH_PV_AVG, \n           y = RELATST)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightblue\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"Student-Teacher Relationship\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Student-Teacher Relation vs Maths\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nrelatst_read &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_sg_data, \n       aes(x = READ_PV_AVG,\n           y = RELATST)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"rosybrown2\", \n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Student-Teacher Relation vs Read\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nrelatst_sci &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_sg_data, \n       aes(x = SCI_PV_AVG,\n           y = RELATST)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"palegreen3\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Student-Teacher Relation vs Science\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\nrelatst_math | relatst_read | relatst_sci\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the relationship between the quality of student-teacher relationships and the Plausible Values for each subject is not very obvious. This could be due to the presence of outliers in the dataset. We will redo the visualisation without the outliers.\n\n\nCodes to generate individual plots\nrelatst_math &lt;- ggplot(data = subset(stu_sg_data, RELATST &gt; -5), \n       aes(x = MATH_PV_AVG, \n           y = RELATST)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightblue\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"Student-Teacher Relationship\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Student-Teacher Relation vs Maths\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nrelatst_read &lt;- ggplot(data = subset(stu_sg_data, RELATST &gt; -5), \n       aes(x = READ_PV_AVG,\n           y = RELATST)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"rosybrown2\", \n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Student-Teacher Relation vs Read\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nrelatst_sci &lt;- ggplot(data = subset(stu_sg_data, RELATST &gt; -5), \n       aes(x = SCI_PV_AVG,\n           y = RELATST)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"palegreen3\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Student-Teacher Relation vs Science\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\nrelatst_math | relatst_read | relatst_sci\n\n\n\n\nFrom the scatterplots above, we can observe that generally, as the perceived quality of student-teacher relationship increases, higher Plausible Values are obtained for each subject. However, we may not be able to conclude that there is a very strong linear relationship between quality of student-teacher relationship and the Plausible Values as the points do not appear to follow closely to a upward-trending line.\nThe observations of the trends between quality of student-teacher relationship and Maths, and quality of student-teacher relationship and Science are generally similar - the rate of increase in Plausible Values appear to be faster when quality of student-teacher relationship is below 0, while it appears to decrease slightly when quality of student-teacher relationship is above 0.\nOn the other hand, the positive relationship between quality of student-teacher relationship and Reading appears to be the weakest. It is observed that the gradient on the best fit curve is small, indicating that there is a small change to Plausible Value as the quality of student-teacher relationship increases."

    "text": "4.5. Relationship Between Sense of Belonging to School and Performance\nFinally, we explore the relationship between the students’ sense of belonging to their schools and their academic performance2. Sense of belonging is also used as a proxy to determine if the students were provided conducive learning environments that could help them excel. The use of this proxy, however, is based on the assumption that a student would feel a greater sense of belonging to the school if the environment was favourable to them building strong social connections, based on how the index was constructed by OECD.\n\n\nCodes to generate individual plots\nbelong_math &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_sg_data, \n       aes(x = MATH_PV_AVG,\n           y = BELONG)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightblue\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"Sense of Belonging to School\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Belonging to School vs Maths\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nbelong_read &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_sg_data, \n       aes(x = READ_PV_AVG,\n           y = BELONG)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"rosybrown2\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Belonging to School vs Maths\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\nbelong_sci &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_sg_data, \n       aes(x = SCI_PV_AVG,\n           y = BELONG)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"palegreen3\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 0.5,\n              color = \"red2\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(150, 850)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Plausible Values\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Belonging to School vs Maths\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\nbelong_math | belong_read | belong_sci\n\n\n\n\nFrom the scatterplots above, it is observed that there is a slight relationship between the students’ sense of belonging to their school and the Plausible Values obtained for each subject. The observations for all three subjects are somewhat similar; most of the observations are clustered between the sense of belonging index of -2 to 2. Within this range, there is a spread of students who received low to high Plausible Values. There are also students whose sense of belonging index is lower than -2 or higher than 2. Similarly, there is also a spread of students who received low to high Plausible Values for each subject."
