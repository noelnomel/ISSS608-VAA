# Data Visualisation Makeover

We were tasked to critique Figure 5 presented in the State of the Industry report prepared by the Data Visualization Society. The figure is on page 14 of the report found in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tETrT7AFar3YUuooWwqgGdIYhmFpaOm/view?pli=1).

-   organisation of the legends is confusing
-   text on pie chart contradicts the legend (e.g. "Employee" is labelled on dark purple segment on pie chart instead of light purple segment)
-   Employee + Other Roles and Employee And Freelance -- are they mutually exclusive?
-   bar chart underneath pie chart is not clear -- how to read??

## Create Additional Individual Plots

We will continue from last week's in-class exercise completed on Tableau.

First, we create a scatterplot of sales vs profit by state.

By default, Tableau aggregates data by default to reduce the number of data points to be rendered. We can toggle this setting under Analysis.

We can toggle the Level of Detail to be displayed on Tableau. For example, we can drag State into the Detail box to display the scatterplot by State

The data points are clustered together. We can use some in-built calculation function on Tableau to transform the raw data points into derived values such as percentile.

The calculation functions can be accessed by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the variable, and selecting Quick Table Calculation

# Tableau Exercise - Exam Data

## scatterplot with marginal boxplot

make individual plot

make dashboard

make coordinated linked view - all plots must have a common link (ID in this case)

## Create Dashboard

A dashboard displays a smaller view of each selected sheet on one single page when published to Tableau Public.

## Create Story

A Story allows us to present each Tableau sheet on a single page when published to Tableau Public.
